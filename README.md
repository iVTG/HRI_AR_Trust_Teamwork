## Task

The project showcases a task intended to be solved by a human wearing a Microsoft HoloLens along with a Robotic/AI companion. The task is to sort blocks into spaces, with the robot handling the odd numbers and the human handling the even numbers. The robot will attempt to help the human if they spend more than 30 seconds moving one of their blocks into place or they place a block in the incorrect place.
